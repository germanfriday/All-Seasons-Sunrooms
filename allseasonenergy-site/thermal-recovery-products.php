    <h5>Thermal Heating &amp; Cooling Recovery Systems</h5>
    <p>Our Thermal Recovery high-velocity recirculating fans use a patented method of collecting warm air beneath the ceiling and returning it to the floor through a narrow, column air path. These units circulate consistently up to 40' above the floor. Larger specialized systems can be designed for custom applications and higher ceilings.</p>
    <p>As soon as the air column reaches the floor, it gently spreads out along the floor, up the walls and and back to the unit, where the process occurs again and again hundreds of times a day. The process equalizes the temperature in the area over a course of a week or two, and destratisfies the environment.</p>
    <p>These systems act as a &ldquo;dynamic insulator&rdquo;. It's much like wrapping your building in a blanket of insulation and dramatically reduces humidity and drafts. The systems run independently and in perfect harmony with the HVAC system and cause the heating &amp; cooling to run 25-100% less depending upon the application. It will not disrupt desired air flow patterns from supply or return air distribution system. Diffuser fans may be turned off, thus saving more energy dollars.</p>
