                    All Seasons Sunrooms uses only tempered, high-performance safety glass in our windows. The tempered glass is 4 times stronger than conventional glass.  The  series of glass is an exclusive All Seasons Sunrooms product that decreases solar heat gain and provides protection against harmful ultraviolet rays.  The glass is then coated with our exclusive sealant that reduces the need to clean the glass.  This surface treatment seals the glass with a teflon-like coating that allows dirt to rinse off the outside of the window.</td>
