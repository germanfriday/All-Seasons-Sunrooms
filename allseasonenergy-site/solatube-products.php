    <h5>Solatube Natural Daylighting Systems</h5>
    <p>The Solatube Daylighting System captures light through a dome on the roof and channels it down through our internal reflective system.</p>
    <p>The tubing is far more efficient than a typical drywall skylight shaft, which can lose over half the potential light. The tube will fit in between rafters/trusses and will install easily with no structural modifications. At the ceiling level, a diffuser that resembles a recessed light fixture spreads light evenly throughout the room.</p>
    <p>With the Solatube System operating during the daylight hours, electric lights are off which means no energy consumption, even on over-cast days. Solatube has no significant heat gain, so air conditioning and heating are not effected. Alternatively, more heat would be lost through a small closed window.</p>
