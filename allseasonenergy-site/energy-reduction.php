        <h4>Overview</h4>
        <p>Unlike typical Energy Performance Contracts, our EIS (Energy Reduction products solution) typically return the investment in 1-3 years, as opposed to 7-10. EIS significantly reduces overall energy consumption and utility bills by 20+%. The cost of the products and installation are rolled into a lease finance over a structured periord of time. The monthly outlay of funds fits into your existing line item for Energy of Utility bills generally with money left over.</p>

        <h4>Example</h4>
        <p>ABC Township's Municipal buildings accrue a $20K per month average electric and gas bill. We reduce the overall cosumption by 20% immediately with proven technologies. The utility bill is now $16K per month. The lease is structured for the Municpality's payment to be $3,500-$4,000 per month over an approximate 24 months for a hypothetical system that costs a total of $90K. The lease payment is structured according to the initial investment amount as well as the Municpality's budget line item. Buy out at the end of the term is typically $1.</p>
        <h4>Benefits</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Little or no upfront cost, typically first and last payment</li>
          <li>Return on Investment/Lease Term is usually 18-36 months</li>
          <li>Positive community outlook on Energy Reduction, good PR</li>
          <li>Reduce overall Carbon Footprint, dramatically reduce carbon emissions into the atmosphere for life of building</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Overall Goal</h4>
        <p>Reduce overall energy consumption forever, and the system pays for itself quickly without the upfront expense. Continue on with a similar Solar and Wind Power Purchase Agreement (SWPPA) immdiately following the first lease, now with a much smaller power generation system needed. Generate a portion or all of your electric needs.</p>
