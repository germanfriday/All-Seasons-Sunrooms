    <h5>Cool-N-Save AC &amp; Refrigeration 
      Pre-Cooling Mist Systems</h5>
    <p>The Cool-N-Save&reg; Commercial pre-cooler is an amazing new product that has taken the known benefits of evaporative AC pre-cooling (more efficient cooling) and combined it with state of the art technology to create the first economical and effective AC pre-cooling mist system that DOES NOT SCALE on the condensor or interfere with airflow.</p>
    <p>It works by cooling the condensor with a super fine mist. This dramatically cools the AC coils allowing them to transfer heat much more efficiently, thus reducing head pressure, amp draw, output temperature, and running time. This equates to 20+% reduction in energy use, with a payback as little as 4 months.</p>
    <p>At the heart of our system is our patent-pending switching system & proprietary &ldquo;Smart Pump&rdquo; that delivers the right amount of water and pressure to each condensor as needed.</p>
    <p>Tulane University - &ldquo;The implication of these results is that by using Cool-N'Save&reg;, even in a climate that endures high humidity, the heat transfer from the refrigerant to the air is substaintially increased&rdquo; (up to 170%)</p>
