    <h5>Water Saving Dual Flush Toilet Retrofit Kits</h5>
    <p><strong>&ldquo;Dual Flush&rdquo; means that the toilet has 2 flush options - the user has choices!</strong></p>
    <p>One flush option is for liquid waste and only requires half of the water in the toilet tank. The other is for solid waste and uses the entire tank resevoir. Replaces the entire internal components of any size two piece toilets.</p>
    <p>One study documented dual flush water savings with flush volumes reduced by 68 percent in single family dwellings, 56 percent in office washrooms, and 52% in restaurants.</p>
