    <h5>Cold Plus&trade; AC, Refrigeration
      and Chiller Treatment</h5>
    <p>Cold Plus&trade; treatment results in substaintially lowered kilowatt usage; commercial, industrial and residential utility savings.</p>
    <p>We guanantee a 10% reduction in the AC / Refrigeration portion of your electric bill; however, after hundreds of studies, the average reduction is 15-23%.</p>
    <p>Our product - Cold Plus&trade;, is a patent-pending refrigerant treatment compatible with all refrigerant and compressor types for Air Conditioning systems, Refrigeration systems, and Chillers. When introduced into the compressor, it interacts with "Oil Fouling" that occurs in most every compressor. The treatment first emulsifies "Oil Fouling", breaking it down into it's original oil solution to flow the system as originally intended.</p>
    <p>Additionally, the Cold Plus&trade; coats all friction bearing compressor parts as well as the copper tubes and valves with a sub-micron polymer that bonds to all metal components. This permanant polymer increases the flow rate of the refrigerant, drastically reducing compressor cycle time.</p>
    <p>Cold Plus&trade; will</p>
